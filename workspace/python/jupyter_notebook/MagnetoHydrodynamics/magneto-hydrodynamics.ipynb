[PhysicsNemo Sim](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-sym/index.html) provides algorithms and utilities used with PhysicsNeMo core to explicitly physics inform the model training, and provides the means for intuitively setting up multi-objective problems.

    "To begin setting up our constraints, we can start by defining the MHD equations using the `PDE` class from `physicsnemo.sym.eq.pde`. The process of converting our PDEs into a form that is compatible with `PhysicsNeMo` involves defining a class to hold our equations, called `MHD_PDE`, and including each term of the equations. Each variable of the equations is set up as a `Sympy` `Function`, which is then used to create an attribute of our `MHD_PDE` class that holds the final `equations`. \n",
